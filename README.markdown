JavaScript Finance Example Code
===============================

This repository contains example code in JavaScript to explain
and demonstrate financial calculations.  It follows the programming
projects suggested in Mark Joshi's "The Concepts and Practice
of Mathematical Finance".

These examples are featured in videos on my YouTube video channel.

Running the Examples
--------------------

The examples are designed to work in both [Node](http://nodejs.org) and 
in the browser.  Run without arguments in Node to see unit tests and
demonstration calculations to standard out.  Code that is specific 
to the browser ends with "UI".
